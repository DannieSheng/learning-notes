Prereqs: 

1) First check java version 
$ java -version 

2) Update ssh key 
$ ssh-keygen -t dsa -P '' -f ~/.ssh/id_dsa
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

NOTE: I found that I still need password to login. I follow these instructions for a fix:
1. ssh-keygen -t rsa
Press enter for each line 
2. cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
3. chmod og-wx ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

3) Check if you can ssh localhost without password 
$ ssh localhost

Standalone Mode install 

1) Download Hadoop from http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/hadoop/common/

2) Find your Java Home directory. 
On OS X  - /usr/libexec/java_home 
On Linux - depends on where you have installed 
If its oracle JDK , then  /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/

3) In the unpacked Hadoop directory go to 
etc/hadoop/hadoop-env.sh
Update the JAVA_HOME to your java home directory

4) In your bash profile, update the environment variables 
export HADOOP_HOME=<Your hadoop home directory>
export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_HOME/bin

export JAVA_HOME=$"/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home"
export HADOOP_PREFIX=/Users/hudanyunsheng/hadoop-3.3.4
