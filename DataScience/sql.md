1. Create Data Pipelines from Raw Data
   1. Apple Jobs
      1. [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aesophor/raw-data)
      2. Suppose this dataset is a live table that stores all of Apple’s job listings, 
      but your manager only needs a table that shows all of the distinct skills mentioned, 
      as well as a count of each skill mentioned segmented by state.
   2. Kickstarter Projects
      1. [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects)
      2. See if you can manipulate the table using SQL so that it shows the number of projects per category, 
      the average goal amount per category, the average amount pledged per category, 
      the percentage of projects that met their goal by category, and the average time from launch to deadline by category.

   1. [Investigating a Drop in User Engagement](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/a-drop-in-user-engagement/)
      1. [info](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/sql-business-analytics-training/)

   2. [Understanding Search Functionality](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/understanding-search-functionality/)
   This case is more focused on product analytics. 
   Here, you’ll be required to dive into the data and determine whether the user experience is good or bad. 
   What makes this case interesting is that it’s up to you to determine what ‘good’ and ‘bad’ means 
   and how the user experience will be evaluated.
   3. [Validating A/B Test Results](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial/validating-ab-test-results/)
   One of the most practical data science applications is performing A/B tests. 
   In this case study, you’ll dive into the results of an A/B test where there was a 50% difference between the control and treatment groups. 
   Your task for this case is to validate or invalidate the results after a thorough analysis.
