People Judge You By The Words You Use. <br>
<br>
Studies over many decades have proven that a strong command of the English language is directly linked to career advancement, to the money you make and even to social success. To move ahead in your career, your vocabulary level must at least equal the average level of the members of your profession. To excel, your vocabulary must surpass that of your colleagues. <br>
<br>
Verbal Advantage was the best investment I have made in my career and myself since college! <br>
- Tom Howfulton, Irvine, CA.  <br>
 <br>
<br>
Every day, people judge you by the words you use. Rightly or wrongly, they make assumptions about your intelligence, your education and your capabilities. Nothing makes a better impression than a solid mastery of the English language. <br>
<br>
Imagine yourself at a business or social gathering. You have the floor. All eyes are on you. You're speaking with confidence and poise, always choosing precisely the right word. This scene could be real with Verbal Advantage.  <br>
 <br>
<br>
Remove Obstacles In Your Path. <br>
<br>
Not having a strong command of language can be a serious handicap, an obstacle that prevents you from achieving your goals. Someone who cannot express ideas eloquently, who hesitates because of uncertainty about the right word, can appear less than fully competent and qualified. Don't let that kind of mistake hold you back from achieving your career goals and from all the other rewards and recognition you deserve. So doesn't it make sense to have at your command as large, as diverse and as exact a vocabulary as possible? <br>
<br>
